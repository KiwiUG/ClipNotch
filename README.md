# ClipNotch

ClipNotch is an **aesthetic clipboard and file manager** built with SwiftUI for macOS.  
It introduces the idea of **Copy** and **Cut Zones** — two simple drag-and-drop boxes where users can drop files, stack multiple items, and move them together in one go.  

---

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- 📂 **Copy Box & Cut Box** – drop files into either zone  
- 🎨 **Smooth animations** for drag & paste confirmations  
- ⚡ **Batch operations** – stack items, then move them all at once  
- 🔔 **Single confirmation** after all files are successfully pasted  
- ⚙️ **Settings** – toggle multiple copy boxes, themes, and paste behavior  

---
